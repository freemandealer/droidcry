Droidcry is a simple transparent en/cryption module for linux.
Droidcry's meant to be just as part of eCryptfs.However it's not
a file system but a module redirecting operations of current file
system. Not like eCryptfs, it's simple enough to be used in some embedded system, e.g. Android devices.

STATUS:
Now it's under construcion and only a pass-through framework
avaliable.

BUILD:
> make -C {kernel directory} SUBDIRS=$PWD modules
And you will get droidcry.ko in current work directory.

INSTALLATION:
> sudo insmod droidcry.ko target="target/path/name"
